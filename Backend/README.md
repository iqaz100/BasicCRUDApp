It was created a simple CRUD app which contains all elements included in main task.

Additionally:

I used serializers and models to data validation.

I used ,,generics" from DRF to implement Views/Endpoints.

I covered models and endpoints with basics tests

All the plugins that I used are in requirements.txt file.

After start u can use 5 urls:

localhost:8000/admin

localhost:8000/api/offers

localhost:8000/api/offers/[ID]

localhost:8000/api/categories

localhost:8000/api/categories/[ID]
